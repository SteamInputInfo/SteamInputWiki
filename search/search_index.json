If you wish to edit existing articles, or add new ones to this wiki please keep reading. This wiki is built with Material for MkDocs and content is managed via GitHub. Edits are submitted as pull requests and issues can be raised in GitHub's issue tracker. We accept pull requests for both content and improvements to the site in general. Roadmap There are still many features that we would like to introduce to make the wiki as helpful and informative as possible. Below is a non-exhaustive list of features we are working on and intend to introduce down the road. Basics - The Basics section is incomplete. We intend to have exhaustive information on all basic input types. Advanced - The Advanced section is incomplete. We intend to have exhaustive information on all advanced configuration options provided by Steam Input. Devices - We hope with the help of the community the Devices section will eventually cover all devices supported by Steam Input. Comments - We should be able to easily add comments to every page on the wiki with the built-in Disqus integration. News - The information provided by this wiki is generally quite static and we don't expect it to change frequently except to correct mistakes or expand articles. There might be a desire to have a dynamic newsfeed that is updated more regularly. There needs to be some investigation into how best to achieve this.","title":"Home"},{"location":"index.html#home","text":"","title":"Home"},{"location":"index.html#how-to-contribute","text":"This wiki is a collaborative effort of the Steam Input/Steam Deck communities, in order for information to stay up-to-date and accurate we rely on contributions from our users.
