# Action Sets

Action sets change the entire control scheme. They can be applied or cycled through by any button-like input on the controller.

For example this could be used in a game where the inventory requires a different control scheme by binding the button which opens the inventory to switch to the inventory action set and (in the inventory action set) the button which closes the inventory to switch back to the main action set.
