# Action Layers

Action layers are an advanced feature which allows you to temporarily change bindings anywhere on the controller (for a simpler option try [mode shifting](./mode_shifting)). Any existing bindings in the current [action set](./action_sets) will remain the same unless specifically changed by the action layer.

You can hold, apply, or remove an action layer with any button-like input. To do this select the left-most icon on the toolbar to the right of the label field.
