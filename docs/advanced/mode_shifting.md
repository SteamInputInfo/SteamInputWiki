# Mode Shifting

Mode shifting is one option (the other being [action layers](./action_layers)) to change the function of an input while another input is being held.

For example you can mode shift the right pad from a mouse to a directional pad while the left grip is held down allowing you to use extra controls without taking your thumb off of the right pad.

It is accessed at the top right of the configuration menu for the following inputs:

* The left and right triggers
* The left and right touchpads
* The left analog stick
* The face buttons

The inputs which can trigger a mode shift are:

* Left and right trigger full and soft pull
* Left and right grips
* Left and right pad clicks
* Analog stick click
* The face buttons
* The start and select buttons
