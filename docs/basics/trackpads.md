# Trackpads

{% include "incomplete.md" %}

The trackpads found on the [Steam Controller](../../devices/steam-controller) and [Steam Deck](../../devices/steam-deck) (and to a lesser extent [DualShock 4](../../devices/dualshock-4) and [DualSense](../../devices/dualsense)) are by far the most versatile inputs available to the user. They are able to effectively emulate practically all other types of input.
